# Metagraphed Backend Artifact Contracts

Metagraphed v1 is backend-first. The public contract is static JSON under `https://api.metagraph.sh/metagraph/*`; UI work can consume these artifacts later without changing the registry pipeline.

## Contract Rules

- `registry/native/finney-subnets.json` is canonical for active Finney subnet existence.
- `registry/subnets/**/*.json` is canonical for curated public interface metadata.
- `registry/candidates/**/*.json` is discovery-only. Candidates are not verified registry surfaces until promotion.
- `registry/adapters/latest/*.json` stores safe adapter snapshots for subnet-specific public metrics.
- `registry/reviews/maintainer-reviewed.json` stores public-safe maintainer review decisions.
- `schemas/components/*.schema.json` is canonical for public API/artifact component schemas.
- `schemas/api-components.schema.json` is a generated bundle and should not be edited by hand.
- `/metagraph/openapi.json`, `/metagraph/types.d.ts`, `generated/metagraphed-api.d.ts`, and `generated/metagraphed-client.ts` are generated from the canonical schema and route metadata.
- `public/metagraph/*` files are compact generated projections and should not be edited by hand. R2-only artifacts must not be committed there.
- `dist/metagraph-r2/metagraph/*` is the ignored staging tree for volatile/detail generated projections that are uploaded to R2.
- Artifact contracts carry `storage_tier`: `dual` for compact Git-plus-R2 artifacts, `r2` for volatile/detail artifacts, and `git` for local-only generated support artifacts.
- Health, RPC, adapter, and schema-drift artifacts are operational observations, not protocol authority.
- No secrets, wallet data, PATs, private dashboards, or validator-sensitive flows belong in any public artifact.
- Zod is not backend contract authority in v1. Zod helpers can be generated later for frontend consumers, but JSON Schema plus AJV remains canonical.

## Core Artifacts

- `/metagraph/contracts.json`: current public artifact contract version and artifact map.
- `/metagraph/providers.json`: provider/source registry.
- `/metagraph/providers/{slug}.json`: per-provider detail payload. R2-backed.
- `/metagraph/providers/{slug}/endpoints.json`: endpoint resources for one provider or operator. R2-backed.
- `/metagraph/api-index.json`: Worker API route map and response-envelope contract.
- `/metagraph/openapi.json`: OpenAPI 3.1 contract for backend API consumers.
- `/metagraph/types.d.ts`: generated TypeScript definitions for consumers.
- `/metagraph/changelog.json`: reviewable generated artifact and subnet-change summary.
- `/metagraph/subnets.json`: compact all-subnet index.
- `/metagraph/metagraph/latest.json`: latest normalized all-subnet metagraph index. R2-backed.
- `/metagraph/subnets/{netuid}.json`: per-subnet detail with native data, curated surfaces, candidates, curation, and gaps. R2-backed.
- `/metagraph/profiles.json`: public-safe subnet identity and completeness profiles.
- `/metagraph/profiles/{netuid}.json`: per-subnet public-safe profile detail. R2-backed.
- `/metagraph/surfaces.json`: curated public surfaces only.
- `/metagraph/surfaces/{netuid}.json`: curated public surfaces for one subnet. R2-backed.
- `/metagraph/surface-aliases.json`: publish-time deprecated `surface_id` alias map for renamed surfaces. The deterministic build emits an empty placeholder; Cloudflare publish fills it from the previous R2 `surfaces.json` + prior alias map before upload.
- `/metagraph/endpoints.json`: generalized endpoint/resource registry derived from curated surfaces and probe observations. Endpoint `id` values derive from stable `surface_key` values; `surface_id` remains the human-readable surface alias.
- `/metagraph/endpoints/{netuid}.json`: generalized endpoint/resource registry for one subnet. R2-backed. Endpoint `id` values derive from stable `surface_key` values; `surface_id` remains the human-readable surface alias.
- Live health overlays, trends, percentiles, incidents, and uptime rollups join/group by `surface_key` when present and keep `surface_id` as the served display alias, so display-name/slug renames do not split probe history.
- `/metagraph/candidates.json`: unpromoted candidate surfaces from public discovery. R2-backed.
- `/metagraph/candidates/{netuid}.json`: unpromoted candidate surfaces for one subnet. R2-backed.

- `/metagraph/curation.json`: curation state for every active subnet.
- `/metagraph/gaps.json`: missing public interface facets by subnet.
- `/metagraph/verification/latest.json`: latest candidate verification results. R2-backed.
- `/metagraph/verification/subnets/{netuid}.json`: latest candidate verification results for one subnet. R2-backed.
- `/metagraph/freshness.json`: freshness and staleness metadata for generated backend data. It exposes `native_data_as_of`, `candidate_discovery_as_of`, `verification_as_of`, `health_probe_as_of`, `adapter_snapshot_as_of`, and stale-window requirements.
- `/metagraph/source-health.json`: source/provider health summary.

- `/metagraph/fixtures.json`: index of captured live request/response fixtures (which surfaces carry a sanitized sample).

Local generated artifacts default to the deterministic review timestamp. Use
`METAGRAPH_BUILD_TIMESTAMP=<iso-8601>` only when a refresh needs an explicit
shared `generated_at` across discovery, build, schema, and R2 manifest
artifacts.

Production publish validation can enforce operational freshness with:

```bash
METAGRAPH_REQUIRE_PROBE_HEALTH=1 METAGRAPH_REQUIRE_FRESHNESS=1 npm run validate
```

Those gates require fresh native subnet data, candidate discovery, candidate
verification, probe-derived health, and adapter snapshots. Schema drift remains
warning-only until more subnets expose machine-readable schemas.

## Cloudflare Runtime

`workers/api.mjs` serves stable `/api/v1/*` JSON envelopes over the canonical artifact tree. It reads from Workers Static Assets first and can fall back to R2 through `METAGRAPH_ARCHIVE` when configured. If the optional `METAGRAPH_CONTROL` KV binding exists, the Worker reads `metagraph:latest` to resolve the current R2 prefix.

The RPC proxy route is intentionally disabled unless `METAGRAPH_ENABLE_RPC_PROXY=true`. When enabled for controlled testing, it only accepts single JSON-RPC POST bodies and blocks write/unsafe methods before any upstream request is made.

## Change-Feed Webhooks + SSE

metagraph.sh regenerates its dataset on an event-driven publish — on each human-input registry merge, plus a daily floor (ADR 0007) — so the realtime surface is a **change feed**: a notification within seconds of each publish, not a sub-second tail. These routes live outside the artifact contract (dynamic, KV-backed) and degrade to `503 webhooks_unavailable` when the `METAGRAPH_CONTROL` KV binding is absent.

- `POST /api/v1/webhooks/subscriptions` — register `{ url, filters?: { netuids?: integer[], kinds?: ("subnets"|"artifacts")[] }, secret? }`. The `url` must be a public `https://` endpoint (private/loopback/link-local hosts and non-default ports are rejected). Returns `{ id, secret, ... }` once; the secret is never echoed again.
- `GET /api/v1/webhooks/subscriptions/{id}` — fetch a subscription's public view (no secret), including a `delivery` health summary (`status` `ok`/`retrying`/`dead_letter`, `pending`/`dead_letter` counts, and a `last_failure` with attempt count, reason, and next-attempt time).
- `DELETE /api/v1/webhooks/subscriptions/{id}` — delete; requires the secret in the `x-metagraph-webhook-secret` header.
- `GET /api/v1/events` — thin SSE change feed: emits the current change snapshot (derived from `changelog.json` + the KV `latest` pointer) as one `event: snapshot`, with `retry: 300000` advising a 5-minute reconnect. There is no value in holding a connection open between publishes.

At publish time the dispatcher reads `changelog.json`, matches each subscription's filters, and `POST`s the change event signed with `HMAC-SHA256` (hex) over the raw body in the `x-metagraph-signature` header. Each delivery also carries `x-metagraph-event-id` (stable per event content) and `x-metagraph-idempotency-key` (stable per subscription + event), so subscribers can dedupe retries safely.

Delivery is **at-least-once**. Within a run a transient failure (network/timeout/5xx/429) is retried with short backoff; if it still fails it is parked per-(subscription, event) under the `webhooks:delivery:<id>:<event_id>` KV prefix and re-attempted on subsequent publish runs with bounded exponential spacing (5 min → 12 h). After 8 failed rounds — or on a deterministic rejection (4xx/redirect) — the delivery becomes a dead letter, surfaced via the `delivery` summary on GET. Successful (re)delivery clears the parked record. Parked records (like subscriptions) auto-expire after 180 days. The SSRF guard is best-effort and cannot prevent DNS rebinding; the dispatcher runs on GitHub-hosted runners with no access to the project's network, which bounds the residual risk.

## Remote MCP Server (AI agents)

`POST /mcp` is a stateless [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server (Streamable HTTP transport, JSON-RPC 2.0) that exposes the registry to AI agents (Claude Desktop/Code, Cursor, autonomous agents). It is read-only, so there is no session id, Durable Object, or server-initiated stream; `GET /mcp` returns `405`. The handler (`src/mcp-server.mjs`) is dispatched before the read-only method gate (it is POST-only, like the RPC proxy) and reuses the exact R2/ASSETS artifact resolution via injected readers, so MCP tools and REST routes always agree.

Tools (thin wrappers over the artifact contract): `search_subnets`, `find_subnets_by_capability`, `get_subnet`, `get_subnet_health`, `list_subnet_apis`, `get_api_schema`, `get_agent_catalog`, `get_best_rpc_endpoint` (live-health-filtered), `registry_summary`, the AI-layer pair `semantic_search` (vector/meaning-based discovery) + `ask` (grounded RAG Q&A with citations), and the goal-shaped pair `find_subnet_for_task` (plain-language task → callable subnets, ranked semantically when AI is present, by keyword otherwise) + `how_do_i_call` (one subnet, by netuid or slug → concrete call instructions: base URL, auth, schema pointer, health). The two AI tools require the VECTORIZE + AI bindings and degrade to a graceful `isError` result (pointing at the keyword tools) when the AI layer is unavailable. `tools/call` returns the MCP result envelope (`content[]` text + `structuredContent`); argument and artifact failures degrade to an `isError: true` result rather than a transport error. The server is validated by `npm run validate:mcp` (lifecycle + one `tools/call` per tool against a cold local env) and smoke-checked live by `scripts/smoke-live-api.mjs`. The endpoint is excluded from the `validate-api` route-count invariant and is added to `assets.run_worker_first`.

`serverInfo.version` is the MCP server's own **SemVer** (`MCP_SERVER_VERSION` in `src/mcp-server.mjs`, also surfaced in the generated `server-card.json`) — deliberately distinct from the date-based `CONTRACT_VERSION` (the REST/data contract), since the tool surface is a separate public contract agents depend on. Bump policy: **add a tool / additive field → minor**; **change or remove a tool's I/O → major**; behavioral-only fix → patch. `validate:mcp` asserts `serverInfo.version` is SemVer and matches the constant.

## AI Search + Ask (semantic + RAG)

Two **out-of-contract dynamic routes** (special-handled like `/api/v1/events`, so they are not in `API_ROUTES`, OpenAPI, or the `validate-api` route-count invariant) power natural-language discovery, backed by Workers AI + a Vectorize index:

- `GET /api/v1/search/semantic?q=&limit=` — embeds the query (`@cf/qwen/qwen3-embedding-0.6b`, 1024-dim) and returns the nearest registry entries `{ score, type, netuid, slug, title, subtitle, url }` (limit ≤ 20). Vector search, so it matches intent without exact keywords.
- `POST /api/v1/ask` — body `{ question }`. Retrieves the top-6 registry entries and prompts `@cf/meta/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct` with a cite-only system prompt, returning `{ question, answer, citations[], context_count, model }`. The answer is grounded in registry context and cites sources as `[n]`.

Both live in `src/ai-search.mjs`, return the standard `{ ok, schema_version, data, meta }` envelope, and are gated three ways: the `METAGRAPH_ENABLE_AI` kill-switch, the presence of the `AI` + `VECTORIZE` bindings (absent in local/CI → `503 ai_unavailable`), and the `AI_RATE_LIMITER` binding (20 req/60s per client IP; absent → allow). Hard caps bound cost: result/context size and a 1000-char question limit. The Vectorize index (`metagraphed-registry-v2`, 1024-dim/cosine) is kept warm by a daily embedding-sync cron (`37 3 * * *`) that diffs the `search.json` index against a content-hash manifest in KV and re-embeds only the deltas. Response shapes are validated by `npm run validate:ai` (disabled→503, stubbed-enabled→200 against `schemas/ai/*.schema.json`, negatives + rate-limit); see ADR 0003.

## Current Domain Scope

Use `metagraph.sh` for the current launch. Do not use `subnet.health` for v1 registry, status, badge, health, or probe contracts.
