# Metagraphed Backend Artifact Contracts

Metagraphed v1 is backend-first. The public contract is static JSON under `https://metagraph.sh/metagraph/*`; UI work can consume these artifacts later without changing the registry pipeline.

## Contract Rules

- `registry/native/finney-subnets.json` is canonical for active Finney subnet existence.
- `registry/subnets/**/*.json` is canonical for curated public interface metadata.
- `registry/candidates/**/*.json` is discovery-only. Candidates are not verified registry surfaces until promotion.
- `registry/adapters/latest/*.json` stores safe adapter snapshots for subnet-specific public metrics.
- `registry/reviews/maintainer-reviewed.json` stores public-safe maintainer review decisions.
- `schemas/components/*.schema.json` is canonical for public API/artifact component schemas.
- `schemas/api-components.schema.json` is a generated bundle and should not be edited by hand.
- `/metagraph/openapi.json`, `/metagraph/types.d.ts`, `generated/metagraphed-api.d.ts`, and `generated/metagraphed-client.ts` are generated from the canonical schema and route metadata.
- `public/metagraph/*` files are compact generated projections and should not be edited by hand. R2-only artifacts must not be committed there.
- `dist/metagraph-r2/metagraph/*` is the ignored staging tree for volatile/detail generated projections that are uploaded to R2.
- Artifact contracts carry `storage_tier`: `dual` for compact Git-plus-R2 artifacts, `r2` for volatile/detail artifacts, and `git` for local-only generated support artifacts.
- Health, RPC, adapter, and schema-drift artifacts are operational observations, not protocol authority.
- No secrets, wallet data, PATs, private dashboards, or validator-sensitive flows belong in any public artifact.
- Zod is not backend contract authority in v1. Zod helpers can be generated later for frontend consumers, but JSON Schema plus AJV remains canonical.

- `npm run validate:openapi-examples`: validate real artifact-backed response examples against OpenAPI.
- `npm run validate:generated-client`: validate the generated TypeScript client helper is current.
- `npm run contract:summary`: compare schema contracts against a base ref and classify changes as additive, risky, or breaking.
- `npm run validate:docs`: validate public docs against current artifact and API contracts.
- `npm run validate:intake`: validate GitHub issue intake templates.
- `npm run candidate:new`: generate a one-candidate community PR file.
- `npm run provider:new`: generate a one-provider-profile community PR file.
- `npm run submission:comment`: render a deterministic Markdown submission report.
- `npm run validate:workflows`: validate workflow hardening rules.
- `npm run worker:deploy:dry-run`: validate Worker/Wrangler deployment shape without contacting Cloudflare.
- `npm run sync:summary`: generate a registry-refresh PR summary from actual artifact diffs.

Local generated artifacts default to the deterministic review timestamp. Use
`METAGRAPH_BUILD_TIMESTAMP=<iso-8601>` only when a refresh needs an explicit
shared `generated_at` across discovery, build, schema, and R2 manifest
artifacts.

Production publish validation can enforce operational freshness with:

```bash
METAGRAPH_REQUIRE_PROBE_HEALTH=1 METAGRAPH_REQUIRE_FRESHNESS=1 npm run validate
```

Those gates require fresh native subnet data, candidate discovery, candidate
verification, probe-derived health, and adapter snapshots. Schema drift remains
warning-only until more subnets expose machine-readable schemas.

## Cloudflare Runtime

`workers/api.mjs` serves stable `/api/v1/*` JSON envelopes over the canonical artifact tree. It reads from Workers Static Assets first and can fall back to R2 through `METAGRAPH_ARCHIVE` when configured. If the optional `METAGRAPH_CONTROL` KV binding exists, the Worker reads `metagraph:latest` to resolve the current R2 prefix.

The RPC proxy route is intentionally disabled unless `METAGRAPH_ENABLE_RPC_PROXY=true`. When enabled for controlled testing, it only accepts single JSON-RPC POST bodies and blocks write/unsafe methods before any upstream request is made.

## Current Domain Scope

Use `metagraph.sh` for the current launch. Do not use `subnet.health` for v1 registry, status, badge, health, or probe contracts.
